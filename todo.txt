TODO (Priority at top):

Presets (Big-Bang PC mode??)
Sequence Export
Sequence Replay
UI Improvements - Buttons n shit
Light up cleared lines (Transparency?)
Hard drop fancy graphics


---

FIX BAGEDIT
 - When requesting the second bag, allows premature termination.
 
 - Add Esc termination without changing the current bag

---
Detailed SRS/wallkick walkthroug
 - choosing prettier colours
 - reverse engineering mode???
	- Choose a position you want the piece to end at
	- Software checks all the different starting rotations that could lead to such a position
	- displays which blocks must be blocked in order for that SRS to work

PC opener preset

Allow preset 6set with I piece in hold
Allow sharing codes for different PC setups, and solutions
Undo and Redo buttons

------- 
Sharing solutions (like fumen???)

Array of moves, move object.
Move object: SD or HD bool
If SD: Render the path to last pos'n

SD object:
- For each rotation, log the x,y (x,y values keyed with alphabet)
- Log the rotation
E.g. AQ110
(0,16)CCW CCW CW

Code rendered as string??
PieceID as int
X,Y posn as letters corresponding to digit 0-20
HD bool 0/1
SD Event as object, find representation later
/ between moves

Hash to compress string?

<pieceID><FinalPOSn><HD><SD Event queue>/


Save each move to an event queue in the export format

Move replays:
Step by step replays??
